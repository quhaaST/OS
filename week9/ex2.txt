Since the aging algorithm emphasizes on setting new pages in the page frames with the lowest counter, we have to be sure that the counter of each page frame is high enough.
This can be achieved if we provide the repeating sequence of page references, like: 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6.
With such sequence (given that page frames number is greater than 5), there will be 6 misses (placing first 6 references) and 6 hits, because at the moment, when reference 1 will appear the 2nd time, the page frame with page 1 will have the lowest counter (which will be increased).
If the number of unique references is greater than the page frames number, then the sequence should firstly reset pages that has the lowest counter.
So, with a sequence 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 7 3 4 5 6 2 (given that number of page frames is 6), there will be 7 misses and 6 hits. (increased hit/miss ratio)
Here we have a page 7 which is placed insted of page 2, so instead of pushing page 2 into the cache right after the 7, we firsly "support" page frames holding 3 4 5 6, to make them stay in the cache longer. 
Whereas, sequence 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 7 2 3 4 5 6 (given that number if page frames is 6) will give us 1 hit and 12 misses. (decreased hit/miss ratio)
