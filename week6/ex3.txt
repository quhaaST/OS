As we can see from the results of FCFS (First Come First Served), Shortest Job First, Round Robin algoritms, each solution has different average turnaround and waiting time for the same input.
For example, Round Robin algorithm has the biggest average waiting time. Since each process here has to work a fixed amount of time, longer processes suffer by waiting way more time, than shorter ones.
However, Shortest Job First algorithm has the least average waiting time because short processes have almost no waiting time as the are executing first.

Speaking about average turnaround time, the biggest average turnaround time has the Round Robin algorithm. The reason for this is the same as for its average waiting time: long processes have to wait a lot because of a fixed amount of time given.
The average turnaround time has for a Shortest Job first and FCFS algorithms is mostly the same. Both algorithms execute the process only once and fully. The only difference may be in a waiting time for each process, where the Shortest Job First alorithm has the least value.
